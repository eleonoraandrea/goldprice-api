# GoldPriceNow Project Status Tracking Template

## 1. Implementation Phases

This project will be implemented in the following phases:

**Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure (Weeks 1-3)**

* **Tasks:**  Setup PostgreSQL database, create user, gold price, and API usage tables; implement core API endpoints (`/register`, `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/dashboard`, `/api/v1/goldprice`); build API key authentication middleware; implement basic user authentication (JWT/session);  set up the gold price fetching service (initial implementation with Yahoo Finance API).
* **Deliverables:** Functional backend API with user registration, login, and a basic gold price endpoint. Database schema complete.  Basic gold price fetching functionality.


**Phase 2: Frontend Development (Weeks 4-6)**

* **Tasks:** Develop landing page, user authentication pages (signup, login, password reset), and user dashboard; integrate with backend API; implement responsive design; create basic styling using Tailwind CSS.
* **Deliverables:** Fully functional frontend, integrated with the backend API, allowing users to register, login, and view the gold price on the dashboard.


**Phase 3:  Premium Features & Refinements (Weeks 7-9)**

* **Tasks:** Implement Stripe payment integration; create premium plan functionality; implement rate limiting;  add API usage statistics to the dashboard; implement Admin panel. Refine gold price fetching logic to include Kitco fallback.
* **Deliverables:** Fully functional premium subscription system; robust rate limiting;  completed admin panel; improved gold price fetching reliability.


**Phase 4: Testing and Deployment (Weeks 10-11)**

* **Tasks:** Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end testing; Dockerize the application; deploy to a VPS or cloud provider; configure SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt); setup monitoring.
* **Deliverables:**  Fully tested application, deployed to production, with SSL enabled and basic monitoring in place.


**Phase 5: Post-Launch Monitoring & Enhancements (Week 12 onwards)**

* **Tasks:** Monitor application performance, address bugs, and gather user feedback; implement optional features (e.g., webhook system, email alerts).
* **Deliverables:** Ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the application, plus iterative improvements based on user feedback and project goals.

## 3. Testing Criteria

* **Unit Tests:**  Individual components (API endpoints, database models, authentication middleware) tested in isolation.
* **Integration Tests:** Interactions between different components tested.  (e.g., frontend interacting with backend, payment gateway integration).
* **End-to-End Tests:** Full user flows tested (e.g., registration, login, purchasing a premium subscription, using the API).
* **Security Tests:**  Vulnerability testing for SQL injection, CSRF, and other common web vulnerabilities.
* **Performance Tests:**  Testing the application's performance under various load conditions.
* **Gold Price Data Accuracy:** Verification that the gold price data is accurate and updated correctly.


## 4. Deployment Stages

1. **Development:**  Development environment setup (local or cloud-based).
2. **Staging:** Deployment to a staging environment mirroring production for final testing.
3. **Production:** Deployment to the live production server (VPS or cloud provider).  Use Docker containers for consistent deployment across environments.  Setup appropriate logging and monitoring tools.  Implement a rollback strategy in case of deployment issues.
